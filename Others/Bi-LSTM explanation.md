In this project, a **Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** network was used to classify requirements as **Functional (F)** or **Non-Functional (NF)** based on text descriptions. Here's a comprehensive overview of how the Bi-LSTM was used and why it was chosen for this task:

### 1. **Why Bi-LSTM for Text Classification?**

The Bi-LSTM model was chosen because:
- **LSTMs** are well-suited for sequential data like text, as they can capture dependencies over long sequences, making them effective for understanding the context within documents.
- **Bi-directional** LSTMs process data in both forward and backward directions, allowing the model to consider both past and future context simultaneously. This is particularly valuable for text, as understanding a word often requires information from both before and after the word in a sentence.

### 2. **Input Preparation**

To leverage Bi-LSTM effectively, embeddings were created that encode the semantic meaning of the text:
- **Doc2Vec** embeddings were used to provide a high-level, document-level representation of each requirement, capturing overall topic and meaning.
- **DistilBERT** sentence embeddings with an **Attention** mechanism were applied to capture the nuances at the sentence level. This attention mechanism helped the model focus on the most important sentences within each document.
- The resulting embeddings from both models were concatenated, resulting in rich feature vectors that combine document-level and sentence-level context.

### 3. **Bi-LSTM Architecture and Configuration**

The Bi-LSTM model used in this project had:
- **Two LSTM Layers**: This provided the model with additional depth, enabling it to learn more complex patterns from the text data.
- **Bidirectionality**: Allowed the model to process information in both directions along the sequence, improving its ability to capture contextual dependencies that can span across sentences.
- **Dropout Layer**: Used for regularization to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some units to zero during training. A small dropout probability of 0.1 helped the model generalize well without losing too much information.
- **Fully Connected Output Layer**: Mapped the output of the LSTM to the two possible classes (Functional and Non-Functional) with a `LogSoftmax` activation to produce log-probabilities.

### 4. **Training with Regularization and Early Stopping**

- **L2 Regularization** (via `weight_decay` in the optimizer) penalized large weights, encouraging the model to avoid overfitting by keeping weights small.
- **Early Stopping** ensured that training stopped once the model performance plateaued on the validation set, preventing overfitting and saving computational resources.

### 5. **Bi-LSTM’s Role in the Classification Pipeline**

Here’s how the Bi-LSTM was integrated into the classification pipeline:
1. **Data Preparation**: Sentences were converted into embeddings using Doc2Vec and DistilBERT with Attention. These embeddings were combined into a single feature vector for each document.
2. **Bi-LSTM Processing**: The combined embeddings were fed into the Bi-LSTM, which learned to capture patterns and relationships within the text data, leveraging both past and future contexts.
3. **Classification**: The output from the Bi-LSTM was passed through a fully connected layer to produce log-probabilities for each class (Functional vs. Non-Functional).
4. **Evaluation**: Predictions were made based on the highest probability, and the model was evaluated for accuracy on the training, validation, and test datasets.

### 6. **Benefits of Using Bi-LSTM in This Project**

- **Contextual Understanding**: The Bi-LSTM’s ability to consider both directions in the sequence helped capture contextual dependencies, which are crucial for accurately classifying requirements.
- **Effective for Sequential Data**: The nature of text as sequential data made Bi-LSTM a good fit, as it retains the order of words and the flow of information, which is essential for understanding the nuances in requirements.
- **Improved Accuracy**: The combination of bidirectionality, attention-enhanced embeddings, and regularization techniques helped the model achieve high accuracy, making it a powerful tool for this classification task.

By using a Bi-LSTM, the model was able to leverage sophisticated textual representations and capture relationships within the sequences, leading to an effective solution for classifying Functional vs. Non-Functional requirements.
### Summary of Modifications and Changes

1. **Model Complexity and Structure**:
   - **Switched to a Two-Layer Bi-LSTM**: We modified the original single-layer Bi-LSTM to a two-layer Bi-LSTM. This allowed the model to capture more complex patterns in the data while leveraging bidirectionality to consider information from both past and future sequences. This change improved the model's ability to learn from sequential data.
   - **Adjusted Hidden Layer Size**: We set the hidden layer size to 128, which is a balanced choice that provides enough capacity to model the data without over-complicating the model.

2. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - **Introduced L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)**: By adding a `weight_decay` parameter to the Adam optimizer, we applied L2 regularization, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. This ensured that the model didn’t overfit to the training data, thereby improving generalization on unseen data.
   - **Reduced Dropout**: Initially, dropout was set relatively high, which might have been too aggressive and disrupted the learning process. We reduced dropout to 0.1, a lower rate that prevents overfitting without overly restricting the model's capacity.

3. **Training Techniques**:
   - **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping with a patience of 5 epochs helped stop training once validation accuracy plateaued. This prevented unnecessary training, saved computation time, and ensured the model didn't overfit by training too long.
   - **Optimal Learning Rate**: A learning rate of `0.001` was used, providing a good balance between convergence speed and model stability. It allowed the model to adjust weights effectively without overshooting optimal values.

### How Each Part Improved Performance

- **Model Definition**: The `AdjustedBiLSTMClassifier` with two layers and a 128 hidden dimension provided more capacity and depth, capturing temporal relationships effectively in the data.
- **L2 Regularization**: Adding `weight_decay` to the optimizer helped regularize the weights, ensuring they didn’t grow too large and helping the model generalize better on the validation and test sets.
- **Early Stopping**: Reduced the risk of overfitting by halting training when improvements plateaued.
- **Lower Dropout**: Lower dropout to 0.1 maintained some regularization without disrupting the learning process, unlike earlier higher dropout rates.

These adjustments made the model more robust and capable of learning complex patterns without overfitting, leading to improved validation and test accuracy. This balance between model complexity and regularization is what allowed the model to achieve a performance closer to your target of 96%.
