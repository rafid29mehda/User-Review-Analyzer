In the code, DistilBERT is used to provide embeddings for individual sentences, and you have a separate sentence-level attention mechanism. The reason for adding a separate sentence-level attention layer in the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) structure, despite DistilBERT's inherent attention mechanism, can be explained as follows:

1. **Hierarchical Structure of Texts**: The core idea of HAN is to handle the hierarchical structure of documentsâ€”starting from words, to sentences, to documents. DistilBERT provides sentence-level representations by capturing the word-level attention within a sentence. However, HAN goes a step further by applying attention between sentences, thus aggregating information across multiple sentences within a document, which DistilBERT alone doesn't address.

2. **Sentence-Level Attention**: DistilBERT is pre-trained primarily to capture intra-sentence relationships (i.e., word-level contextual embeddings within a sentence). But in documents, the relationships between sentences (i.e., inter-sentence attention) are also important, especially for tasks involving multi-sentence reasoning. The separate sentence-level attention mechanism allows the model to prioritize certain sentences over others, which is important for tasks where some sentences in a document carry more significance than others for classification purposes.

3. **Aggregating Sentence Information**: By applying the custom sentence-level attention mechanism, the model learns to weigh different sentences in a document differently, depending on their importance to the overall document classification task. DistilBERT alone does not learn these inter-sentence dynamics, which is why the additional sentence attention layer is needed to capture this higher-level structure.

In summary, even though DistilBERT captures word-level and sentence-level embeddings, the sentence-level attention layer in HAN is necessary to capture document-level context by learning which sentences contribute most to the final classification task. This hierarchical approach ensures that the model can effectively handle both intra-sentence and inter-sentence information.
