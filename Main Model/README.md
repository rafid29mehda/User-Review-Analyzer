**Introduction**

The code implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for text classification. It aims to classify documents into two categories: Functional (F) and Non-Functional (NF) requirements. The approach combines embeddings from a pre-trained Doc2Vec model and a fine-tuned Transformer model to represent textual data effectively. These embeddings are then reduced in dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used to train a neural network classifier. The model's performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.

**Detailed Explanation of the Code**

Let's break down the code step by step, explaining how it works, its benefits, potential usefulness, and possible issues.

```python
!pip install gensim transformers torch scikit-learn tqdm

import pandas as pd
from google.colab import files
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from gensim.models import Doc2Vec
from tqdm import tqdm
import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
```

- **Purpose**: Install and import all the necessary libraries required for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- **Benefits**: Ensures all dependencies are met and modules are readily available for use.

---

### **2. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset**

```python
# Upload the CSV file
uploaded = files.upload()

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(next(iter(uploaded)))  # Assumes the first uploaded file is your dataset

# Map 'RequirementType' to 'labels' (Functional: 1, Non-Functional: 0)
label_mapping = {'F': 1, 'NF': 0}
df['labels'] = df['RequirementType'].map(label_mapping)

# Check if the 'labels' column was created correctly
print(df[['RequirementType', 'labels']].head())
```

- **How it Works**:
  - **Data Upload**: Prompts the user to upload a CSV file containing the dataset.
  - **Data Loading**: Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
  - **Label Mapping**: Converts categorical labels ('F' and 'NF') into numerical labels (1 and 0).
- **Benefits**: Preprocessing the labels makes them suitable for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.
- **Potential Issues**: Assumes the dataset is correctly formatted and contains the 'RequirementType' column.

---

### **3. Loading Pre-trained Models**

#### **a. Loading the Doc2Vec Model**

```python
# Download and load the Doc2Vec model from Hugging Face
model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="RafidMehda/doc2vec_model", filename="doc2vec_model")
doc2vec_model = Doc2Vec.load(model_path)
```

- **How it Works**:
  - Downloads a pre-trained Doc2Vec model from the Hugging Face Hub.
  - Loads the model into the environment.
- **Benefits**: Leverages pre-trained embeddings to represent documents, which can capture semantic meanings effectively.
- **Potential Issues**: Requires internet connectivity and assumes the model exists at the specified location.

#### **b. Generating Doc2Vec Embeddings**

```python
def get_doc2vec_embeddings(index):
    doc2vec_emb = doc2vec_model.dv[str(index)]
    return torch.tensor(doc2vec_emb).numpy()

doc2vec_embeddings = [get_doc2vec_embeddings(i) for i in range(len(df))]
```

- **How it Works**:
  - Retrieves the Doc2Vec embedding for each document in the dataset.
  - Converts embeddings to NumPy arrays for further processing.
- **Benefits**: Provides a dense representation of documents, capturing their semantic content.

---

#### **c. Loading the Fine-Tuned Transformer Model**

```python
# Load tokenizer and model from the fine-tuned Hugging Face model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("RafidMehda/app_review_model")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("RafidMehda/app_review_model")
```

- **How it Works**:
  - Loads a fine-tuned Transformer model (e.g., BERT) and its tokenizer from Hugging Face.
- **Benefits**: Uses state-of-the-art NLP models that understand contextual relationships in text.
- **Potential Issues**: Similar to Doc2Vec, this step requires internet access and assumes the model is available.

#### **d. Generating Transformer Embeddings**

```python
def get_finetuned_embeddings(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        last_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state
        pooled_embedding = torch.mean(last_hidden_state, dim=1)  # Average pooling
    return pooled_embedding.squeeze().numpy()

# Generate embeddings using the fine-tuned model for the dataset
finetuned_embeddings = [get_finetuned_embeddings(doc) for doc in df['content']]
```

- **How it Works**:
  - Tokenizes each document and passes it through the Transformer model.
  - Uses average pooling over the last hidden states to get a fixed-size embedding.
- **Benefits**: Captures contextual and semantic information at a deeper level compared to traditional methods.
- **Potential Issues**: Computationally intensive; may require significant processing power for large datasets.

```python
# Introduce some label noise by shuffling 3% of labels randomly (optional step)
np.random.seed(42)
noise_ratio = 0.03  # 3% noise
num_noisy_labels = int(noise_ratio * len(y))
noisy_indices = np.random.choice(len(y), num_noisy_labels, replace=False)

# Flip the labels at noisy indices
y[noisy_indices] = 1 - y[noisy_indices]  # Invert the labels
```

- **How it Works**:

        super(CombinedEmbeddingClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 256)  # Reduced from 512 to 256
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(0.5)  # Increased dropout to 0.5
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)  # Reduced from 256 to 128
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(0.5)  # Increased dropout to 0.5
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, num_labels)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout1(x)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.dropout2(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
