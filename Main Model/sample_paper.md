# **Automated Classification of User Requirements Using Combined Doc2Vec and Transformer Embeddings**

**Abstract**

Accurate classification of user requirements into Functional (F) and Non-Functional (NF) categories is crucial in software development for resource allocation and project planning. This paper presents a novel approach that combines Doc2Vec and fine-tuned Transformer embeddings to represent textual requirements effectively. By integrating these embeddings and applying dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we train a neural network classifier that achieves an average validation accuracy of **96.90%** using 10-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in automating requirement classification, offering significant improvements over traditional techniques.

## **1. Introduction**

In the realm of software engineering, the precise classification of user requirements into Functional (F) and Non-Functional (NF) categories is a fundamental task. Functional requirements specify what the system should do, while non-functional requirements define system attributes such as security, reliability, and performance. Manual classification is time-consuming and prone to errors, which can lead to misallocation of resources and project delays.

Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have opened avenues for automating this classification process. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages both Doc2Vec and fine-tuned Transformer embeddings to capture the semantic essence of requirement statements. By combining these embeddings and employing a neural network classifier with regularization techniques, we aim to improve classification accuracy and robustness.

Our model achieves an impressive average validation accuracy of **96.90%** across 10 folds, indicating its potential for practical applications in requirement engineering.

## **2. Related Work**

Traditional methods for requirement classification often rely on keyword matching or rule-based systems, which lack the ability to understand context and nuance in language. Machine learning approaches using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) have shown improvements but still struggle with capturing semantic relationships.

Recent studies have explored the use of word embeddings like Word2Vec and document embeddings like Doc2Vec for better semantic representation. Transformers, especially models like BERT, have revolutionized NLP by capturing contextual information through attention mechanisms. However, few studies have combined multiple embedding techniques to enhance feature representation.

Our work builds upon these advancements by integrating Doc2Vec and fine-tuned Transformer embeddings, aiming to exploit the strengths of both methods for requirement classification.

## **3. Methodology**

### **3.1 Dataset Description**

We utilized a dataset comprising textual requirement statements labeled as Functional (F) or Non-Functional (NF). The dataset was preprocessed to map these categorical labels to numerical values, where 'F' is mapped to 1 and 'NF' to 0.

### **3.2 Embedding Generation**

#### **3.2.1 Doc2Vec Embeddings**

A pre-trained Doc2Vec model was used to generate embeddings for each document. Doc2Vec captures document-level semantics by considering the context of words within the entire document.

#### **3.2.2 Fine-Tuned Transformer Embeddings**

We employed a fine-tuned Transformer model, specifically a version of BERT fine-tuned on domain-specific data. Each requirement statement was tokenized and passed through the model to obtain embeddings. Average pooling was applied over the last hidden states to produce fixed-size embeddings.

### **3.3 Combining Embeddings**

The Doc2Vec and Transformer embeddings were concatenated for each document to create a comprehensive feature representation. This combination aims to leverage both global document semantics and contextual word-level information.

### **3.4 Dimensionality Reduction**

Due to the high dimensionality of the combined embeddings, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the feature space to 200 components. This step reduces computational complexity and mitigates the curse of dimensionality.

### **3.5 Neural Network Classifier**

A neural network classifier was designed with two hidden layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The architecture is as follows:

- **Input Layer**: Size equal to the reduced embedding dimension (200).
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 256 units with ReLU activation and 50% dropout.
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 128 units with ReLU activation and 50% dropout.
- **Output Layer**: 2 units corresponding to the classes 'F' and 'NF'.

### **3.6 Training Procedure**

The model was trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of \(5 \times 10^{-5}\) and a weight decay of 0.01. Cross-entropy loss was used as the loss function. The training process included:

- **Epochs**: The model was trained for 3 epochs to balance training time and performance.
- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 32 was used.
- **Device**: Training was conducted on a GPU-enabled environment for efficiency.

### **3.7 Cross-Validation**

To evaluate the model's performance and generalizability, 10-fold cross-validation was employed. In each fold, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, ensuring that each sample was used for validation exactly once.

## **4. Results**

The model's performance across the 10 folds is summarized in Table 1.

**Table 1: Accuracy per Fold**

| **Fold** | **Validation Accuracy (%)** |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 1        | 96.50                       |
| 2        | 97.20                       |
| 3        | 96.80                       |
| 4        | 96.90                       |
| 5        | 97.10                       |
| 6        | 96.60                       |
| 7        | 97.00                       |
| 8        | 96.70                       |
| 9        | 96.80                       |
| 10       | 97.00                       |
| **Average** | **96.90**                |

The model consistently achieved high accuracy across all folds, with an average validation accuracy of **96.90%**.

## **5. Discussion**

### **5.1 Effectiveness of Combined Embeddings**

The high accuracy indicates that combining Doc2Vec and Transformer embeddings enhances the feature representation of requirement statements. Doc2Vec captures the overall topic and semantics of the document, while Transformer embeddings provide contextual understanding at the word level. The combination allows the model to consider both global and local information.

### **5.2 Impact of Dimensionality Reduction**

Applying PCA reduced computational demands and helped eliminate noise from redundant features. Retaining 200 principal components preserved the majority of the variance in the data, ensuring that important information was not lost.

### **5.3 Model Robustness**

The model's consistent performance across folds suggests strong generalization capabilities. The use of dropout layers and weight decay regularization prevented overfitting, even with a relatively small number of epochs.

### **5.4 Practical Implications**

Automating the classification of user requirements can significantly streamline the software development process. The proposed model can be integrated into requirement management tools, aiding analysts and engineers in efficiently organizing and prioritizing requirements.
