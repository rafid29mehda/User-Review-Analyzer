"From this review, itâ€™s clear that while various approaches have made strides in improving classification accuracy, they face significant limitations. 

- **Machine Learning methods** have struggled with capturing contextual dependencies and semantic nuances.  
- **Deep Learning models**, such as Word2Vec and LSTM, lacked the ability to integrate broader document structures and were less effective with smaller datasets.  
- **Transformer-based models** like BERT improved accuracy but failed to effectively combine document-level and word-level semantics.  
- Additionally, many methods focused narrowly on functional requirements, neglecting non-functional requirements or other quality attributes.
