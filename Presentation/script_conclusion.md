**Introduction (5-7 seconds):**
"As we come to the end of this presentation, let’s summarize the key outcomes and contributions of the H2AN-BiLSTM model."

---

**Summary (20-25 seconds):**
"The H2AN-BiLSTM model successfully addresses the challenges of classifying software requirements, particularly in distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements. By combining Doc2Vec for document-level semantics and DistilBERT for word-level contextual understanding, the model achieves a comprehensive representation of the text. Most impressively, it delivers a state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.40%, outperforming both traditional approaches and standalone models, proving its robustness and effectiveness."

---

**Key Contributions (15-20 seconds):**
"The model makes two significant contributions. First, it offers a hybrid, scalable solution for software requirement classification, combining global and local semantics in a single architecture. Second, it automates and streamlines the classification process with high precision and reliability, making it an invaluable tool for software engineers and researchers."

---

**Conclusion and Closing (10-15 seconds):**
"In conclusion, the H2AN-BiLSTM model not only pushes the boundaries of software requirement classification but also opens doors for future advancements in this domain. Thank you for your attention, and I’m happy to take any questions."
