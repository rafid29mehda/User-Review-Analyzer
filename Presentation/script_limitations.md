**Slide Title:** Limitations and Future Work

---

**Introduction (5-7 seconds):**
"Before wrapping up, it’s important to acknowledge the current limitations of our model and discuss how we can address these in future research to make the model even more robust and versatile."

---

**Limitations (15-20 seconds):**
"While the H2AN-BiLSTM model has shown strong performance, there are a few areas where it can be improved. Firstly, it focuses solely on binary classification—distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements—limiting its applicability to more nuanced tasks. Secondly, the model relies heavily on pre-trained embeddings like Doc2Vec and DistilBERT. While these embeddings are powerful, their general nature may not fully capture the domain-specific nuances needed in specialized fields."

**Transition to Future Directions (5 seconds):**
"However, these limitations open up exciting opportunities for future research and development."

---

**Future Directions (20-25 seconds):**
"To address these challenges, there are three key directions we can explore. First, we can extend the model to support multi-label classification, enabling it to handle more complex requirements that belong to multiple categories. Second, we can apply this model to other domains, such as medical or legal fields, where requirements analysis plays a critical role. Lastly, we can leverage domain-specific pre-trained models to better align with the unique characteristics of specialized datasets, further improving classification accuracy."
