**Slide Title:** Model Performance Analysis

---

**Introduction (5-7 seconds):**
"Let’s now look at the performance metrics of our proposed H2AN-BiLSTM model. This table summarizes the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy across the training, validation, and test datasets."

---

**Point 1: Training Dataset (10-15 seconds):**
"On the training dataset, the model achieved a precision and F1-score of 95%, with a recall of 96%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 95.88%. This indicates the model is well-trained to classify functional and non-functional requirements effectively."

---

**Point 2: Validation Dataset (10-15 seconds):**
"On the validation dataset, the precision and recall were slightly lower at 94% and 95%, respectively, but the F1-score remained consistent at 95%. The accuracy of 95.30% demonstrates strong generalization, ensuring the model performs well on unseen validation data."

---

**Point 3: Test Dataset (10-15 seconds):**
"Finally, on the test dataset, the model achieved a precision of 92% and recall of 95%, with an F1-score of 95% and an overall accuracy of 94.40%. These metrics confirm the robustness of the model in real-world scenarios."

---

**Conclusion and Transition (10 seconds):**
"In summary, the model demonstrates high performance across all datasets, with strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, ensuring reliable classification. Next, let’s explore how this performance compares to other approaches and models."
