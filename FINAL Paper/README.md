## **Overview of the Project**

### **Objective**

The primary goal of your project was to develop a hybrid NLP model capable of accurately classifying user reviews into **Functional (F)** and **Non-Functional (NF)** categories. This classification is crucial for understanding user feedback, improving products, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### **Methodology**

Your approach involved several key steps:

1. **Data Preparation and Labeling**

   - **Datasets Used**:
     - **PROMISE_exp.csv**: A labeled dataset used to train a model capable of labeling other data.
     - **reviews.csv**: An unlabeled dataset of user reviews from the Google Play Store.
   - **Labeling Unlabeled Data**:
     - Fine-tuned a BERT model on **PROMISE_exp.csv**.
     - Used the fine-tuned BERT model to label the reviews in **reviews.csv** as Functional (F) or Non-Functional (NF).
     - Resulted in a newly labeled dataset for further training.

2. **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**

   - **Doc2Vec**:
     - Fine-tuned on the labeled **reviews.csv** to obtain **document-level embeddings**.
     - Captures global semantic information of entire documents.
   - **DistilBERT**:
     - Fine-tuned on the same dataset to obtain **contextualized word-level embeddings**.
     - Provides rich contextual information at the word level within sentences.

3. **Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) Construction**

   - **Sentence-Level Embeddings**:
     - Used DistilBERT to generate embeddings for each sentence in a review.
     - Applied a **sentence-level attention mechanism** to focus on the most informative sentences.
   - **Combining Embeddings**:
     - **Doc2Vec Embeddings**: Represent the overall document context.
     - **Attention-Weighted Sentence Embeddings**: Represent important local contexts.
     - Concatenated both embeddings to form a comprehensive representation of each review.
   - **Classification with Bi-LSTM**:
     - Input the combined embeddings into a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network.
     - The Bi-LSTM captures sequential dependencies and patterns.
     - Output passed through a fully connected layer for final classification into F or NF categories.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**

   - Implemented early stopping and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation.
   - Achieved improved accuracy and performance over baseline models.

## **Impact on the NLP Field**

### **Addressing Key Challenges**

1. **Integrating Global and Local Contexts**

   - **Challenge**: Traditional models often focus on either document-level semantics or word-level context, not both simultaneously.
   - **Your Solution**: By combining Doc2Vec and DistilBERT embeddings within a HAN framework, your model effectively captures both global and local contextual information.

2. **Hierarchical Modeling of Text**

   - **Challenge**: Natural language has inherent hierarchical structures (words → sentences → documents), which many models fail to exploit fully.
   - **Your Solution**: The use of HAN leverages this hierarchy, allowing the model to focus on significant words and sentences through attention mechanisms at multiple levels.

3. **Improved Text Classification**

   - **Impact**: Enhanced accuracy in classifying user reviews can lead to better sentiment analysis, user feedback interpretation, and overall improvements in customer experience management.

### **Innovative Methodology**

- **Novel Combination of Models**:
  - The integration of fine-tuned Doc2Vec and DistilBERT embeddings within a HAN is a novel approach.
  - It leverages the strengths of both embeddings while mitigating their individual limitations.

- **Advancement of HAN Applications**:
  - Extends the application of HAN beyond traditional use cases.
  - Demonstrates the versatility of HAN in handling combined embeddings from different sources.

- **Potential for Broader Applications**:
  - The methodology can be generalized and applied to other NLP tasks requiring nuanced understanding at multiple levels (e.g., summarization, topic modeling).

## **Uniqueness and Contribution to Research**

### **Why This Paper is Unique**

1. **Hybrid Embedding Integration**

   - **Existing Research**: Previous works have utilized either document-level embeddings (like Doc2Vec) or contextualized word embeddings (like BERT-based models) independently.
   - **Your Contribution**: Combines both types of embeddings in a unified model, capturing a more holistic representation of text data.

2. **Hierarchical Attention Mechanism**

   - **Existing Research**: HANs have been used with single embedding sources but rarely with combined embeddings.
   - **Your Contribution**: Innovatively applies HAN to integrate different levels of embeddings, enhancing the model's ability to focus on important information at both word and sentence levels.

3. **Enhanced Classification Performance**

   - **Demonstrated Improvement**: Through experiments, you showed that your model outperforms baseline models, indicating the effectiveness of your approach.

4. **Addressing Real-World Problems**

   - **Practical Relevance**: Classifying user reviews is a practical problem with significant implications for businesses and product development.
   - **Applicability**: Your model provides a viable solution that can be adopted in industry settings.
